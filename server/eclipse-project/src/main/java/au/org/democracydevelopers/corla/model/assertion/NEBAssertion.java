 * A Not Eliminated Before (NEB) assertion compares the tallies of two candidates W and L in
 * the context where W is given all votes on which they are ranked first, and L is given all
 * votes on which they appear before W (or they appear and W does not). This equates to comparing
 * the minimum possible tally for W against the maximum possible tally for L while W is still
 * continuing. If this assertion holds, it means that W can never be eliminated while L is
 * still continuing, or that W will always have more votes than L.
