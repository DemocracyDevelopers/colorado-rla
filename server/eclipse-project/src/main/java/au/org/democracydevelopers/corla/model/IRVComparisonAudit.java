/**
 * A class representing the state of a single audited IRV contest across one or more counties.
 * When an IRVComparisonAudit is constructed, the base ComparisonAudit constructor is called.
 * This will invoke methods to compute initial sample sizes for the audit. For IRV audits,
 * however, these initial sample sizes will not be meaningful as the audit's assertions are
 * not loaded until the ComparisonAudit base constructor finished. The IRVComparisonAudit
 * constructor will load the relevant assertions from the database (populating the audit's
 * assertions list), compute the audit's diluted margin, and then re-invoke the sample size
 * computation methods. This class overrides some of the methods in the base ComparisonAudit
 * class: recalculateSamplesToAudit(); initialSamplesToAudit(); computeDiscrepancy();
 * riskMeasurement(); removeDiscrepancy(); and recordDiscrepancy().
 *
 * DISCREPANCY MANAGEMENT
 * Colorado-rla uses the following logic for computing and storing discrepancies:
 * 1. Call the ComparisonAudit's computeDiscrepancy() method given a CVR and audited ballot.
 * Return any discrepancy found as an OptionalInt.
 * 2. If there was a discrepancy, call the ComparisonAudit's recordDiscrepancy() method N times
 * where N is the number of times the ballot appears in the sample (sampling is by replacement).
 *
 * RE-AUDITING OF BALLOTS:
 * If a ballot is being re-audited, all discrepancies associated with the matching CVR are
 * removed by calling removeDiscrepancy() N times where N is the number of times the ballot
 * appears in the sample. Steps 1, and 2 if needed, above are then performed.
 *
 * For IRV audits, a CVR and audited ballot may represent a different type of discrepancy for
 * different assertions, or a discrepancy for some assertions and not for others. When this
 * class' computeDiscrepancy() method is called, a corresponding method in each of the audit's
 * assertions is called. If a discrepancy is found with respect to an assertion, the CVR ID and
 * discrepancy type will be stored in its cvrDiscrepancy map. Each assertion has its own
 * recordDiscrepancy() and removeDiscrepancy() method. When their recordDiscrepancy() method
 * is called, its cvrDiscrepancy map will be looked up to find the right discrepancy type, and the
 * assertion's internal discrepancy totals updated. Similarly, when removeDiscrepancy() is called,
 * the cvrDiscrepancy map will be looked up to find the discrepancy type, and the assertion's
 * discrepancy totals updated. The CVR ID - discrepancy type entry in its cvrDiscrepancy() map
 * is not removed, however, it is only removed if computeDiscrepancy() is called again and either
 * a different or no discrepancy is found.
