/**
 * An assertion is a statement comparing the tallies of two candidates in varying contexts.
 * A RAIRE audit of an IRV contest involves checking a finite set of assertions. If we verify
 * that the set of assertions holds (with the desired degree of confidence) then we have ruled
 * out all possible outcomes in which the reported winner did not win. Each assertion is associated
 * with an expected number of ballots to sample when checking in an audit, and will have an
 * associated risk. Subclasses of this abstract base class are defined for the different types
 * of RAIRE assertion. Assertions are created and stored in the database by raire-service. They
 * are audited by colorado-rla. During this process, the record of discrepancies attached to
 * the assertion will be updated, as well as its estimated sample sizes and risk.
 *
 * A NOTE ON DISCREPANCY MANAGEMENT:
 * The class level comment of the IRVComparisonAudit class describes how discrepancies are
 * managed by ComparisonAudit's.
 *
 * Of particular note for assertions:
 * If a discrepancy is found with respect to an assertion, the CVR ID and discrepancy type will be
 * stored in its cvrDiscrepancy map. Each assertion has its own recordDiscrepancy() and
 * removeDiscrepancy() method. When their recordDiscrepancy() method is called, its cvrDiscrepancy
 * map will be looked up to find the right discrepancy type, and the assertion's internal discrepancy
 * totals updated. Similarly, when removeDiscrepancy() is called, the cvrDiscrepancy map will be
 * looked up to find the discrepancy type, and the assertion's discrepancy totals updated. The CVR
 * ID - discrepancy type entry in its cvrDiscrepancy() map is not removed, however, it is only
 * removed if computeDiscrepancy() is called again and either a different or no discrepancy is found.
 * Note that recordDiscrepancy() and removeDiscrepancy() is designed to be called N times for a
 * particular CVR/audited ballot pair if that ballot appears N times in the sample.
