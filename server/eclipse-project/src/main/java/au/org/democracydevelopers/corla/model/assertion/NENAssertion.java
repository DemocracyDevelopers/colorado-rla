/**
 * A Not Eliminated Next (NEN) assertion is defined between two candidates W and L in the context
 * where an assumed set of candidates (including W and L) are 'continuing'. What this assertion
 * says is that in the context where everyone outside the assumed 'continuing' list has been
 * eliminated, W has more votes than L. This means that in the context where only the assumed
 * continuing candidates remain, W will not be eliminated next as L will have fewer votes.
