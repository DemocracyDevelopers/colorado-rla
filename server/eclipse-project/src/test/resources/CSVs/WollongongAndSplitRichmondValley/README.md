This directory contains all of the Wollongong Mayoral data in one 
(obviously named) file, plus all of the Richmond Valley mayoral data 
spread over 3 files:
- a rounded-up quarter is appended to the Wollongong data, in the Wollongong file (this is why the file is called `City_of_Wollongong_Mayoral_PlusRVM_Q3_R1.csv`), 
- half is in `Richmond_Valley_Mayoral_First_Half.csv`
- a quarter is in `Richmond_Valley_Mayoral_LastQuarter.csv`.

The \*Half file has exactly twice the votes of the \*Quarter file.
Both these files have their own manifest, in the directory. 
Use `/NewSouthWales21/City_of_Wollongong_Mayoral.manifest.csv` as the
manifest for `City_of_Wollongong_Mayoral_PlusRVM_Q3_R1.csv`.
