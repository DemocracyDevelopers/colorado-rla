/**
 * This workflow runner is designed to run in a UAT environment in which the raire service, colorado-rla
 * server and corla database are all set up and running.
 * 1. You will need a copy of the colorado-rla code, which you can either clone with
 * `git clone https://github.com/DemocracyDevelopers/colorado-rla.git`
 * `git clone git@github.com:DemocracyDevelopers/colorado-rla.git`
 * or download as a zip from
 * https://github.com/DemocracyDevelopers/colorado-rla/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
 * 2. Use src/test/resources/test.properties to specify the raire url, database login credentials and
 * url/port of the main colorado-rla server.
 * 3. Ensure that maven and java are installed.
 * 4. Ensure that the database contains correct setup data such as administrator credentials,
 * which can be loaded from colorado-rla/test/corla-test.credentials.psql, and the list of Colorado
 * counties. Note that once these are in the database, you may execute the command in Step 6
 * repeatedly without resetting the database. At the start of running a workflow (with RAIRE), the
 * database is reset.
 * 5. Ensure that the colorado-rla server and raire-service are running.
 * 6. From the eclipse-project directory, to run a workflow json file via the command line, enter
 * `mvn test -Dtest="*WorkflowRunnerWithRaire" -DworkflowFile="[Path to workflow file]"`
 * For example, to run the AllPluralityTwoVoteOverstatementTwoRounds workflow, enter
 * `mvn test -Dtest="*WorkflowRunnerWithRaire" -DworkflowFile="src/test/resources/workflows/instances/AllPluralityTwoVoteOverstatementTwoRounds.json"`
 * You can also run the test in your IDE - instructions for IntelliJ are at
 * <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-with-tests-in-maven.html#skip_test">...</a>
 * This test is skipped when the tests are run with default parameters, i.e. during automated testing.
 *
 * This deliberately does _not_ reset the database after the workflow runs. This might be helpful if
 * someone wants to examine its state via the client afterwards.
